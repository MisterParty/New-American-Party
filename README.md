# New American Party (working name)

It has become abudently clear that today's ruling political discourse is 
insufficient in the United States.  Economic elites have been shown to 
have substantial impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens
have little or no influence[^1].

A political party should be minimally defined by a set of core, fundamental 
philosophical values. A platform based on those values should be justified by 
empirical truth ("evidence") whereever possible insofar that any part of the 
platform is epistemologically categorized as a well justified true belief.

It is not always possible, however, to predicate policy by evidence. 
In many cases, policy must be made to handle something new before proper 
justification for that policy is available.  In those cases, it makes sense to 
always judge in favor of personal freedom ("freedom") so as to not restrict 
behavior where policymakers are unsure.  

## The Role of Evidence

Evidence is non-anecdotal, reproduceable, and verifiable information that 
reinforces a belief or claim.  Any piece of this platform is challengable by 
contradictory evidence on a case-by-case basis in the form of pull requests.

In cases where evidence is not strong (or not available), policy must always be 
made in favor of freedom. Any policy that infringes on an individual's negative 
or positive freedom must be associated with evidence to be admissible into 
the platform. 

## The Role of Government

Government should be primarily focused on protecting the liberty of the 
individual.  There are two types of individual liberty that are pertinent here:

1. **Social Liberty**: Provided an individual does not infringe on another 
   individual's rights to act freely, the government should not be involved 
   except in cases to reduce harm.
2. **Economic Liberty**: The ability of an individual to undertake economic 
   actions.  In many cases free markets can infringe on the individual's 
   right or ability to take economic actions, so therein we support 
   an economic bill of rights for individuals.

## Social Liberty

Social liberty is the level of government involvement, as defined by analysis of harm reduction, required to ensure individuals' rights to act freely are not infringed upon.

1. **Individual Rights**: The rights of every individual must be articulated simply, likened to that of the Constitution.

   A) Health: the right to be treated as a human being with regards to healthcare issues
   
   B) Speech: when not directly infringing upon anothers' individual rights
   
   C) Education: the role of education is formative in a more enlightened society. Forms thereof and cost/benefit analysis needed.
   
   C) Privacy: elimination of mass surveilance and require a minimum of notifying individuals when their data is collected
   
   D) Etc. To be amended.

2. **Quality of Life**: The government cannot ensure a perfect quality of life for everyone given the current resource pool and the damage the extremes of pure communism or socialism would inflict. Analysis aimed at ensuring basic human rights is required to fully articulate this sentiment. Ideas such as longevity, health, protection, safety, education, and resource diversion through taxation need be fully understood before policies can be developed. The ultimate goal is to maximize benefits for all individuals, both in aggregate and on an individual level, to acheive our objective.

   A) **Longevity**: The cost benefit analysis of longevity intervention must be assessed. Declining marginal returns on longevity intervention must be weighed as the cost from whom resources are diverted for the sake of increasingly smaller returns for those who receive the benefit. Longevity increases in an S-Curve fashion according to the wealth of the individual[^1]. Therefore the inflection point of decreasing marginal returns, and how quickly they decline relative to the available resource pool, must be fully understood.

   B) **Health**:
