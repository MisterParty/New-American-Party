# New American Party (working name)

It has become abudently clear that today's ruling political discourse is 
insufficient in the United States.  Economic elites have been shown to 
have substantial impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens
have little or no influence[^1].

A political party should be minimally defined by a set of core, fundamental 
philosophical values. A platform based on those values should be justified by 
empirical truth ("evidence") whereever possible insofar that any part of the 
platform is epistemologically categorized as a well justified true belief.

It is not always possible, however, to predicate policy by evidence. 
In many cases, policy must be made to handle something new before proper 
justification for that policy is available.  In those cases, it makes sense to 
always judge in favor of personal freedom ("freedom") so as to not restrict 
behavior where policymakers are unsure.  

## The Role of Evidence

Evidence is non-anecdotal, reproduceable, and verifiable information that 
reinforces a belief or claim.  Any piece of this platform is challengable by 
contradictory evidence on a case-by-case basis in the form of pull requests.

In cases where evidence is not strong (or not available), policy must always be 
made in favor of freedom. Any policy that infringes on an individual's negative 
or positive freedom must be associated with evidence to be admissible into 
the platform. 

## The Role of Government

Government should be primarily focused on protecting the liberty of the 
individual.  There are two types of individual liberty that are pertinent here:

1. **Social Liberty**: Provided an individual does not infringe on another 
   individual's rights to act freely, the government should not be involved 
   except in cases to reduce harm.
2. **Economic Liberty**: The ability of an individual to undertake economic 
   actions.  In many cases free markets can infringe on the individual's 
   right or ability to take economic actions, so therein we support 
   an economic bill of rights for individuals.
